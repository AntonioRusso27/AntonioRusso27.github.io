        <p>Saturday afternoon, something just pulled me out of my chair and took me to the cinema. I had to watch this movie before it was too late.</p>
        <p class="lead">Doing something for myself felt strange, maybe I'm just not used to it.</p>
        <p>Somehow this film touched on this very topic. Watching the protagonist live its daily routine so calmly, quietly and, in a way, happily, made me want to grow some plants in my room, enjoy a nice book or just take a deep breath and take everything one little step at a time.</p>
        <p>The littlest things seemed to make him so happy that I even started envying him but soon realized what was behind them.</p>
        <p>Just like me, he fights against his past, trying to keep his composure even though he's hurt and obliged to live with it.</p>
        <p>In the end it seemed like a sweet surrender or an endless hope for a new day. A <strong>new day</strong> when we either <em>stop</em> doing the same mistakes lying to ourselvers to run away or end up stuck in that loop.</p>
        <p class="lead">I got to the cinema feeling hopeless and got out waiting for my new day.</p>
